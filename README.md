# Interdisziplin√§res Arbeiten (IA)

This project demonstrates a robot control system integrating a PS5 DualSense controller with a Raspberry Pi Pico. It includes features for remote control and line-following capabilities using a PID controller.

## Features
- **Controller Integration:** Utilize a PS5 DualSense controller for robot operations.
- **Line Following:** Line tracking capability with a digital IR sensor array.
- **Modular Design:** Configurable settings for sensors, motors, and PID parameters.
- **Network Connection:** Seamless integration with local WiFi networks.
- **Custom GUI:** Easy-to-use interface for remote operations.


## Requirements
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi Pico, PS5 DualSense controller, IR sensor array, and DC motors.
- **Libraries:**
  - [PyDualSense](https://github.com/flok/pydualsense) - For controller support (Windows/Linux only).
  - [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) - GUI framework.
  - Python's built-in libraries for GPIO and PWM control.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Configure Settings
1. Open `config.py`.
2. Update settings to match your hardware, including:
   - Motor pins
   - Sensor pins
   - WiFi credentials.

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. Transfer the following files to the Raspberry Pi Pico:
   - `config.py`
   - `main.py`
   - `PiConnectionPC.py`
   - `motor_controll.py`
   - `PID.py`

### Step 3: Connect to Network
1. Power on the Raspberry Pi Pico.
2. Wait for the onboard LED to turn green, indicating a successful network connection.

### Step 4: Run the Controller
1. Execute `LocalPC.py` on your computer.
2. Ensure the controller vibrates to confirm a connection.

## Usage
1. Connect the robot to power.
2. Use the GUI to send commands via the DualSense controller.
3. Adjust PID parameters and motor speeds for optimal performance.

## Future Enhancements
- Expanded sensor support.
- Improved error handling and robustness.
- Enhanced documentation.

### Code Review

#### Strengths
1. **Modularity:** Clear separation of concerns with dedicated files for configuration, motor control, and PID logic.
2. **Scalability:** Configuration through `config.py` enables easy adaptation for different hardware.
3. **Error Handling:** Graceful stopping of motors and handling of connection drops in `PID.py`.

#### Recommendations
1. **Documentation:**
   - Expand function-level docstrings to explain inputs, outputs, and edge cases.
   - Provide examples for common operations (e.g., PID tuning).

2. **Code Structure:**
   - Consider splitting `motor_controll.py` into separate modules for initialization and operations.
   - Consolidate redundant logic (e.g., speed normalization).

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Add logging for critical actions (e.g., network events, sensor anomalies).
   - Implement retry mechanisms for WiFi and controller connections.

4. **Scalability:**
   - Introduce interfaces or base classes for sensor and motor drivers for easier hardware changes.
   - Use configuration files (e.g., JSON or YAML) instead of hardcoding in `config.py`.

5. **Testing:**
   - Develop unit tests for key functionalities like PID control and motor handling.
